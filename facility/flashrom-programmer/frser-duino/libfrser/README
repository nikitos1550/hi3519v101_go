This is the hardware-independent parts of frser pulled out 
so one can easily use them in different flashers.
Also included some hardware-specific bits (SPI) that can
be used by multiple flashers.

The point is to include this stuff as a subfolder (eg. git submodule)
in your project and point your Makefile to the .c 
files when you're compiling your project and -I the folder.
---
Or alternatively, in your makefile:
include libfrser/Makefile.frser

Also maybe other makefile fragments that are provided.

Your project should contain real versions of the headers
named *.example and implement the stuff - also the stuff
in frser-flashapi.h.
