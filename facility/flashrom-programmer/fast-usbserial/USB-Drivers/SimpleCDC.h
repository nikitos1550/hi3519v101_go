 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Device/CDC.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USBCLASS)</i>
 *
 *  \section Module Description
 *  Device Mode USB Class driver framework interface, for the CDC USB Class driver.
 *
 *  \note There are several major drawbacks to the CDC-ACM standard USB class, however
 *        it is very standardized and thus usually available as a built-in driver on
 *        most platforms, and so is a better choice than a proprietary serial class.
 *
 *        One major issue with CDC-ACM is that it requires two Interface descriptors,
 *        which will upset most hosts when part of a multi-function "Composite" USB
 *        device, as each interface will be loaded into a separate driver instance. To
 *        combat this, you should use the "Interface Association Descriptor" addendum to
 *        the USB standard which is available on most OSes when creating Composite devices.
 *
 *        Another major oversight is that there is no mechanism for the host to notify the
 *        device that there is a data sink on the host side ready to accept data. This
 *        means that the device may try to send data while the host isn't listening, causing
 *        lengthy blocking timeouts in the transmission routines. To combat this, it is
 *        recommended that the virtual serial line DTR (Data Terminal Ready) be used where
 *        possible to determine if a host application is ready for data.
