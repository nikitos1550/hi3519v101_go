    This is file streamer API. 
    File streamer is different compared to other streamers.
    It allow you to store recordings on local FS (supposed that it is placed on USB/SD).

    Besides recording functionality, it allows you not only download captured data, but also
    perform realtime packaging to various formats (mp4, HLS, etc) and provide acces to 
    same recorded data in such formats.
