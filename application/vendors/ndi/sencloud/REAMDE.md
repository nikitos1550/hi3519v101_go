Subject: RE: Vendor ID

 

Hello.

 

I have uploaded a new build of the NDI Embedded SDK that incorporates your new vendor ID here:

https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArRUZ4qdf_bVoStLV-httrkqEDVO

 

Here is the new vendor information:

 

    Vendor name: Anhui SEN-Cloud

    Vendor ID: E4651A8F-C223-472E-9467-D9756B2A6C27

 

The following is an example of how to use the vendor information:

 

    const char* ndi_config = R"({

      "ndi": {

        "vendor": {

          "name": "Anhui SEN-Cloud",

          "id": "E4651A8F-C223-472E-9467-D9756B2A6C27"

        }

      }

    })";

    NDIlib_send_instance_t ndi_sender = NDIlib_send_create_v2(nullptr, ndi_config);

 

Thank you!
